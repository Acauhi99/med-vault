# Roadmap

This document outlines the phased delivery plan for MedVault. Each phase builds on the previous one, following the project's documentation-first principle.

**Testing philosophy:** Unit tests and integration tests only. See [TESTING_STRATEGY.md](docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md).

**Quality gates:** Pre-commit, pre-push, unified Taskfile. See [QUALITY_GATES.md](docs/QUALITY_GATES.md).

**Acceptance criteria:** Detailed checklist per phase. See [CHECKLIST.md](docs/CHECKLIST.md).
